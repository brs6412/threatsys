This has been a WIP throughout the week, doing a little bit whenever I can, but here is what I did:
 - Worked through Angular tutorial to understand basic Angular syntax and functionality
 - Learned about API integration in Angular and how to pass data around
 - Looked into Angular Material: Google's official design system (I assume this would be like React Bootstrap)
 - Researched best practice for Angular Containerization, ending up with a specialized Nginx configuration from Docker docs
 - Got the docker-compose.yml file working, able to run a `docker compose` command to set up services
 - TODO: refine data schema, add API endpoints for querying, make my site look pretty

What I worked on:
 - Spent a few hours refactoring my development plan and changed up my tech stack a little. 
 - Looked at FastAPI examples and best practices for setting up a reliable backend.
 - Learned about Pydantic, very useful tool for data validation and serialization.
 - Set up initial FastAPI server with various endpoints for user related operations.
 - Using in memory Python dictionary (to be replaced with PostgreSQL).
 - Set up basic CRUD API endpoints for managing User objects.
 - Looked at best practice for writing Dockerfiles for FastAPI applications.
 - Created simple dockerfile, including a non-root user setup for improved container security.
 - Used Postman to manually test API endpoints and debug server responses. 

Skills: FastAPI framework, Pydantic, RESTful API design, 
    Basic Dockerfile setup and container security
