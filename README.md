What I worked on:
 - Spent a few hours refactoring my development plan and changed up my tech stack a little. 
 - Looked at FastAPI examples and best practices for setting up a reliable backend.
 - Learned about Pydantic, very useful tool for data validation and serialization.
 - Set up initial FastAPI server with various endpoints for user related operations.
 - Using in memory Python dictionary (to be replaced with PostgreSQL).
 - Set up basic CRUD API endpoints for managing User objects.
 - Looked at best practice for writing Dockerfiles for FastAPI applications.
 - Created simple dockerfile, including a non-root user setup for improved container security.
 - Used Postman to manually test API endpoints and debug server responses. 

Skills: FastAPI framework, Pydantic, RESTful API design, 
    Basic Dockerfile setup and container security
